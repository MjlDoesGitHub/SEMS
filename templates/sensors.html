                    MQ135 Sensor 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MQ135 is a gas sensor that will be used for the SEMS will detect chemicals such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
                    nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The specific gas sensor that we will be using is an infrared gas sensor, which will measure 
                    the absorption of infrared radiation by analyzing the presence of different gas molecules. Gas molecules have distinct absorption 
                    spectra, and by looking at how much infrared light is absorbed by the gas, which will allow us to determine the specific concentration 
                    of the gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gas sensors are of high importance as in medical rooms, they can guarantee patient safety. Potential gasses that can be detected in 
                    medical rooms include anesthetic gasses that have concentrations of nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide. Furthermore, oxygen in operation 
                    rooms and critical care areas need to be monitored as it needs to remain at an appropriate level for patients who may suffer from respiratory 
                    issues. In regards to areas where diseases are easily exposed, gas sensors will be useful in that a certain level of oxygen must be maintained 
                    in order to prevent the spread of airborne pathogens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sensing Material: The MQ-135 sensor contains a sensing material or a sensitive layer that is typically composed of a tin dioxide (SnO2) 
                    semiconductor. This sensing material has a high surface area and is sensitive to a wide range of gasses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gas Interaction: When the MQ-135 sensor is exposed to the surrounding air, gas molecules in the environment interact with the sensing 
                    material. Different gasses have unique chemical interactions with the SnO2 material, causing a change in the electrical conductivity of 
                    the material. This change is often due to the alteration of charge carriers (electrons) in the sensing material.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Output Signal: The voltage output from the MQ-135 sensor will be ready by our microcontroller to determine the concentration of the 
                    target gas based on the resistance change and calibration data.

                    GMC Sensor 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Geiger Nuclear Radiation Detector measures the radiation level, which will function by detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. 
                    This detector will serve the purpose of rapid detection of ionizing radiation, but does not necessarily have the ability to distinguish 
                    between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, even though this should not pose a problem for the intended application of our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gas-Filled Tube: The core component of a Geiger counter is a gas-filled tube. The gas used is typically a low-pressure inert gas, such as argon, neon, or helium. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anode and Cathode: Inside the tube, there are two electrodes: an anode (positively charged) and a cathode (negatively charged). These electrodes are separated 
                    by the gas-filled region. A high voltage, typically in the range of 300 to 700 volts, is applied between the anode and cathode. This voltage creates an electric 
                    field within the gas-filled tube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indicators: The electrical discharge produced by the ionization events is detected and amplified by the Geiger-Muller tube. This electrical signal is typically 
                    audible as a series of clicks or beeps and may also be used to trigger a visual indicator, such as a needle on a meter or a digital readout, to display the radiation 
                    level. Each click or pulse corresponds to a single ionization event, and the rate of these clicks is directly proportional to the intensity of the radiation.

                    DHT22 Sensor 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The temperature and humidity sensor will detect what the ideal levels will be for patient comfort. Furthermore, maintaining a proper 
                    temperature can ensure that there is no significant spread of pathogens and that medications are stored in a way that 
                    ensures they can be used in the long-term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sensing Element: Inside the DHT22 sensor, there is a sensing element that is made of a moisture-sensitive organic material. This element 
                    changes its electrical resistance in response to changes in temperature and humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Capacitive Element: The DHT22 uses a capacitive humidity sensor to measure the relative humidity. When the humidity changes, it causes 
                    the capacitance of the sensor to change as well. The sensor has two electrodes, and the capacitance between them varies with humidity. 
                    A change in capacitance corresponds to a change in relative humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Temperature Element: In addition to humidity, the DHT22 has a built-in NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor to measure temperature. 
                    The resistance of the thermistor decreases as the temperature increases. By measuring the resistance, the sensor can determine the temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Signal Conditioning: The DHT22 sensor includes an onboard microcontroller that converts the resistance and capacitance measurements into digital 
                    signals. It also performs signal processing and calibration. The microcontroller is factory-calibrated, which means the sensor is ready to provide 
                    accurate temperature and humidity readings without the need for user calibration.

                    LTR390 Sensor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UV sensors would be used in devices like UV-C disinfection robots and UV-C room sterilizers to control the spread of 
                    infections in healthcare facilities. And in a similar vein, UV sensors help ensure that the correct dosage of UV radiation is applied, 
                    preventing the transmission of infections through these medical procedures. In dental and orthopedic applications, UV sensors are used 
                    to monitor the UV curing process of resins and adhesives, ensuring that the materials set and harden correctly in dental fillings, 
                    orthodontic appliances, and other medical devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Light Absorption and Photocurrent: When light, whether in the visible or UV spectrum, falls on the sensor, it is absorbed by the photodiodes. 
                    The absorbed light energy generates electron-hole pairs within the photodiode material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Signal Conditioning: The LTR390-UV sensor includes signal conditioning circuitry to convert the generated photocurrents into electrical 
                    voltage signals. These voltage signals are then processed and converted into digital data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visible Light Sensing: The visible light photodiode can measure the intensity of visible light, making it useful for applications like ambient 
                    light sensing for displays or adjusting the brightness of screens and displays based on the surrounding light conditions.
